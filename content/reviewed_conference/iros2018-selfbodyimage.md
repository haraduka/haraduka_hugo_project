abstract = "Tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoids have many benefits in terms of the flexible spine, multiple degrees of freedom, and variable stiffness. At the same time, because of its body complexity, there are problems in controllability. First, due to the large difference between the actual robot and its geometric model, it cannot move as intended and large internal muscle tension may emerge. Second, movements which do not appear as changes in muscle lengths may emerge, because of the muscle route changes caused by softness of body tissue. To solve these problems, we construct two models: ideal joint-muscle model and muscle-route change model, using a neural network. We initialize these models by a man-made geometric model and update them online using the sensor information of the actual robot. We validate that the tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid Kengoro is able to obtain a correct self-body image through several experiments."
