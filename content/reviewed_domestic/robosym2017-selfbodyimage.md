abstract = "The tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid has many benefits in terms of the flexible spine, multi-DOF, and variable stiffness. At the same time, because of its body complexity, there are problems in controllability. First, due to the large difference between the geometric model and actual robot, it cannot move as intended and large internal muscle tension can emerge. Second, movements which do not appear as changes in muscle length can emerge, because of the muscle route change caused by body tissue softness. To solve these problems, we constructed two models: ideal joint-muscle model and muscle-route change model, by neural network. We initialized these models by a man-made geometric model and updated them online using sensor information of the actual robot. The humanoid was able to obtain a correct self-body image, and we validated its effectiveness through several experiments."
